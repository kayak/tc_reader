# Configuration for the tc_reader.

# tcCmdPath is the path to the TC command.
# Default: "/sbin/tc"
tcCmdPath = "/sbin/tc"

# ParseInterval is the interval in seconds in which tc_reader executes the TC
# command and gets the Qdisc and Class statistics. Whenever SNMP daemon queries
# tc_reader, it gets the statistics received from the last poll.
# Default: 5
parseInterval = 5

# TcQdiscStats are the command arguments for TC needed to get Qdisc statistics.
# The arguments should be separated by spaces.
# Default: "-s qdisc show dev"
tcQdiscStats = "-s qdisc show dev"

# TcClassStats are the command arguments for TC needed to get Class statistics.
# The arguments should be separated by spaces.
# Default: "-s class show dev"
tcClassStats = "-s class show dev"

# Ifaces are the interfaces on which we want to monitor Qdiscs and Classes.
# The interfaces should be separated by spaces.
# Default: "eth0"
ifaces = "eth0 eth1 eth2"

# User names can be listed multiple times and define users. User is simply a
# combination of two Qdiscs / Classes, one for upload and the other one for
# download. Combining them this way simplifies graphing in cacti, e.g you can
# display both the upload and the download direction on one graph, even though
# the classes are located on dofferent interfaces.
# Format: user = "name" "uploadName" "downloadName"
# Separators are either tabs or spaces.
# Default: none
user = "user1" "eth0:2:3" "eth1:2:3"
user = "user2" "eth0:2:4" "eth1:2:4"

# debug enables extensive logging to syslog. Allowed values are true or false.
# Default: false
debug = true
ifaces = "eth0 eth1 eth2"
